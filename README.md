- Python, for example 3.7
- Tesseract OCR, for example https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
- pip3 install pytesseract

Add Tesseract OCR to your system variables:

- new SYSTEM VARIABLE - PATH (for example): C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR\

Take a look at the "QuizMaster-ProgrammPlan.png" and "example.png" to understand how the Python script works and how you can configure the width and height values for your individual needs.
